                <p class="personalInformation">My name is James, but I am usually referred to as Jim. My wife and I live
                    in
                    Wisconsin. We spent most of our marriage in Utah, but also lived in Mauritius Africa for a time. We
                    have
                    three adult children who all live in Utah. Until last month, I was the CTO of a company which
                    automated
                    regulatory compliance for electrical infrastructure, but I was laid off. I am now doing contract
                    work
                    and looking for a job. My wife and I are preparing to serve a mission when I retire, but that may
                    now be
                    a bit farther out than I anticipted.

                    Mauritius is an island nation in the Indian Ocean. It is located about 900 Km east of Madagascar.
                    Mauritus consists of four islands. The main island is called Mauritus, or La Maurice in French. The
                    other islands in this country are Rodrigues, Agal√©ga, and St. Brandon. The island is beautiful, the
                    people we met were wonderful, and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is very much in
                    its
                    pioneer stage in that nation. When we served there, there were only 242 members of the Church on the
                    island. Mauritius was the home of the Dodo bird. The island has no native mammal species and no
                    native
                    macro preditors.
