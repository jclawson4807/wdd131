            <h2>Welcome to Family Heritage Discovery
            </h2>
            <p>Family Heritage Discovery focuses on helping people discover their family heritage. Once development is
                complete, the site will be hosted at familyheritagediscovery.org. Our site is for people who
                want to learn about family history generally, and about their families specifically. You can sign up for
                our weekly newsletter, which will be written by experienecd researchers and software developers who help
                build family history tools. Our newsletter will provide weekly tips and family history relatead news.
                We will provide articles about gathering family history information from family members, step by
                step how-tos to help you with research, and more. We are working on a video series in which our
                researchers will help new genealogists sign up on research sites, do family interviews, enter
                information into online family trees, and solve difficult research dilemas. Who knows, maybe we can help
                you! We envision a day when the site will include a moderated community space where people can ask for
                research help, as well as basic productivity tools focused on doing family history research.</p>
