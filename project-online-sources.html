                <p>Family Heritage Discovery focuses on helping people discover their family heritage. Once development
                    is complete, the site will be hosted at familyheritagediscovery.org. Our site is for people who
                    want to learn about family history generally, and about their families specifically. You can sign up
                    for our weekly newsletter, which will be written by experienecd researchers and software developers
                    who help build family history tools. Our newsletter will provide weekly tips and family history
                    relatead
                    news. We will provide articles about gathering family history information from family members, step
                    by step how-tos to help you with research, and more. We are working on a video series in which our
                    researchers will help new genealogists sign up on research sites, do family interviews, enter
                    information into online family trees, and solve difficult research dilemas. Who knows, maybe we can
                    help you! We envision a day when the site will include a moderated community space where people can
                    ask for research help, as well as basic productivity tools focused on doing family history research.
