                    Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints though FamilySearch International. The functionality
                    provided on FamilySearch is vast, and new features are provided frequently. FamilySearch is free to
                    use, and the access to the site is not restricted to members of the Church of Jesus Christ of
                    Latter-day Saints.

                    FamilySearch provides a full-featured tree builder, along with access to billions of searchable records including census, marriage, death, and other vital records.  The tree tool includes a source management feature with source citation tracking.  Users can search a shared global family tree, and add names to the tree.  There are also tools for merging duplicate person records
                </p>
                <p>
                    FamilySearch also provides access to special record collections.  For example, there are Immigration records, African American records, US and Canadian Census records, and more.  FamilySearch also provides an Indexing tool, which allows volunteers to extract information from source records, and make that information available to other users of the system. This information allows records to be found using the various search engines built into the site.  FamilySearch also provides guided tree building tools, research hints, and virtual memory books to which users can add images and stories about their family members.

                   We will provide how-to articles and tutorials for our users focused on learning how to use FamilySearch, which is one of the premiere resources for family history researchers.
